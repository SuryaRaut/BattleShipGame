#BattleShipGame
Implementation of two player battle ship console game in C#

there will be two 10x10 grid for player 1 and 2.
after running the project there pops up 10x10 grids for player 1 to set up their 5 ships. once playr 1 is done, player two gets to set up their ships. 
then player 1 will get an opportunity to fire shot at opponent, if he misses the shot (he gets message from player to wheather he misses or hit or sunk the oppenent ship) player 2 will have an opportunit to fire shot at opponent's grid. and if the player hits on grid where oppnent's ships are placed they get another chance to fire the shot. If either of player succeds to sunk all ships of the oppnent, that player will be the winner.
